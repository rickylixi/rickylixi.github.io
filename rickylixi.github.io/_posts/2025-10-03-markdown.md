# How do I use Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic syntax rules to get you started:

## Headers

Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

```
# This is a heading 1
## This is a heading 2
### This is a heading 3
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

- *Italic* text can be created using single asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold** text can be created using double asterisks or underscores.

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

You can create links using the following syntax:

```
[Link text](http://example.com)
```

## Images

To add images, use the following syntax:

```
![Alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code

For inline code, wrap the text in backticks:

```
Here is some `inline code`.
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```
```
function test() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```
```

## Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes using the `>` symbol:

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a simple way to format text that can be converted to HTML. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and blog posts. Happy writing!
