1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.

这是一个行内公式：\\( E = mc^2 \\) 或者 $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$。

这是一个行间公式：
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
# How do I use Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic syntax rules to get you started:

## Headers

You can create headers by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

```
# This is a level 1 header
## This is a level 2 header
### This is a level 3 header
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

- *Italic* text can be created using asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold** text can be created using double asterisks or double underscores.

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

## Links

You can create links by wrapping the link text in brackets and the URL in parentheses.

## Images

You can add images using a similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark in front.

![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

## Code

You can include inline code using backticks, and you can create code blocks by indenting with four spaces or using triple backticks.

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a simple way to format text that can be converted to HTML. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and blog posts. Happy writing!
