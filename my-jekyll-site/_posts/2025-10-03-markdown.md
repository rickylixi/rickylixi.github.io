# How do I use Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic syntax rules to get you started:

## Headers

You can create headers by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

```
# This is a level 1 header
## This is a level 2 header
### This is a level 3 header
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

- *Italic* text can be created using asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold** text can be created using double asterisks or double underscores.

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

## Links

You can create links by wrapping the link text in brackets and the URL in parentheses.

## Images

You can add images using a similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark in front.

## Code

You can include inline code using backticks, and you can create code blocks by indenting with four spaces or using triple backticks.

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a simple way to format text that can be converted to HTML. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and blog posts. Happy writing!
