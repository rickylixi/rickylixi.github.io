# Principles of metaphysical certainty

## First principles a priori

> Nothing can at the same time be and not be, but everything either is
or is not.

> Nothing is without a reason.

## First principles of a posteriori knowledge (or, of logical certainty)

> Every perception of my present thinking is true.

## Principle of moral certainty

> Everything which is confirmed by many indications, which can hardly
concur except in the truth, is morally certain, i.e. incomparably more
probable than its opposite.

## Principle of physical certainty

> Everything which men have experienced always and in many ways will
still happen: e.g. that iron sinks in water.

## Principles of topical knowledge

> Everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is.

> The more probable is that which has fewer requisites, or, which is
easier.

> "All natural phenomena could be explained mechanically if we
> understood them well enough, but the principles of mechanics
> themselves cannot be so explained\...since they depend on more
> substantive principles\...The final analysis of the laws of nature
> leads us to the most sublime principles of order and perfection, which
> indicate that the universe is the effect of a universal intelligent
> power\...It is wrong that laws are entirely indifferent, since they
> originate in the wisdom of their Author or in the principle of
> greatest perfection\...The most beautiful thing about this view seems
> to me to be that the principle of perfection is not limited to the
> general but descends also to the particulars of things and of
> phenomena and that in this respect it closely resembles the method of
> optimal forms, that is to say, of forms which provide a maximum or
> minimum\...If in the case of the curve of shortest descent between two
> given points, we choose any two points on this curve at will, the part
> of the line intercepted between them is also necessarily the line of
> shortest descent with regard to them. It is in this way that the
> smallest parts of the universe are ruled in accordance with the order
> of greatest perfection; otherwise the whole would not be so ruled."


> "**As God calculates, so the world is made.**"[^1]

> "Everything happens mechanically in nature, that is, according to
> certain mathematical laws prescribed by God....Unless physical things
> can be explained by mechanical laws, God cannot, even if he chooses,

> "If there were no best among all possible worlds, God would not have
> created one."
>
> "**The simplicity of means is balanced against the richness of
> ends**....The simplicity of God's ways relates to the means he adopts,
> while their variety, richness or abundance relate to ends or effects.
> These should be in balance with one another, as the money for putting
> up a building has to be balanced against its desired size and beauty.
> Admittedly, whatever God does costs him nothing---even less than it
> costs a philosopher or scientist to invent theories out of which to
> build his imaginary world---for God can bring a real world into
> existence merely by decreeing it. But in the exercise of wisdom by God
> or a scientist there is something analogous to the cost of a building,
> namely the number of independent decrees or theories that are
> involved. For God's creative activity to be economical is for it to
> involve very few separate decrees; for a scientific theory to be
> economical in its means is for it to have very few basic principles or
> axioms. Reason requires that multiplicity of hypotheses or principles
> be avoided, rather as the simplest system is always preferred in
> astronomy."[^3]

> "*Some hypotheses can satisfy so many phenomena, and so easily, that

> proceeds by hypotheses, assuming certain causes, perhaps, without
> proof, and showing that the things which now happen would follow from
> these assumptions. A hypothesis of this kind is like the key to a
> cryptograph, and the simpler it is, and the greater the number of
> events that can be explained by it; the more probable it is....The
> same effect can have several causes. Hence no firm demonstration can
> be made from the success of hypotheses. Yet I shall not deny that the
> number of phenomena which are happily explained by a given hypothesis
> may be so great that it must be taken as morally certain. Indeed,
> hypotheses of these kind are sufficient for everyday use. Yet it is
> also useful to apply less perfect hypotheses as substitutes for truth
> until a better one occurs, that is, one which explains the same
> phenomena more happily or more phenomena with equal felicity. There is
> no danger in this if we carefully distinguish the certain from the
> probable."
>
> "It must be admitted that a hypothesis becomes the more probable as it
> is simpler to understand and wider in force and power, that is, the
> greater the number of phenomena that can be explained by it, and the
> fewer the further assumptions. It may even turn out that a certain
> hypothesis can be accepted as physically certain if, namely, it
> completely satisfies all the phenomena which occur, as does the key to
> a cryptography. Those hypotheses deserve the highest praise (next to
> truth), however, by whose aid predictions can be made, even about
> phenomena or observations which have not been tested before; for a

>
> Furthermore, in order to explain a bit more distinctly how temporal,
> contingent, or physical truths arise from eternal, essential or
> metaphysical truths, we must first acknowledge that since something
> rather than nothing exists, there is a certain urge for existence or
> (so to speak) a straining toward existence in possible things or in
> possibility or essence itself; in a word, essence in and of itself
> strives for existence. Furthermore, it follows from this that all
> possibles, that is, everything that expresses essence or possible
> reality, strive with equal right for existence in proportion to the
> amount of essence or reality or the degree of perfection they contain,
> for perfection is nothing but the amount of essence.
>
> Hence it is very clearly understood that out of the infinite
> combinations and series of possible things, one exists through which
> the greatest amount of essence or possibility is brought into
> existence. There is always a principle of determination in nature
> which must be sought by maxima and minima; namely, that a maximum
> effect should be achieved with a minimum outlay, so to speak....
>
> Thus we now have a physical necessity derived from a metaphysical
> necessity, for although the world is not metaphysically necessary,
> where its contrary would imply a contradiction or logical absurdity,
> nevertheless it is physically necessary, that is, determined so that
> its contrary would imply imperfection or moral absurdity. And just as
> possibility is the principle of essence, so perfection or degree of
> essence is the principle of existence (since the degree of perfection
> determines the greatest number of things that are compossible). This
> shows at once how there may be freedom in the Author of the world,
> even though he does all things determinately because he acts on the
> principle of wisdom or perfection. Indifference arises from ignorance,
> and the wiser a man is, the more determined he is toward the most
> perfect....
>
> We therefore have the ultimate reason for the reality of essences as
> well as existences in one being, which must necessarily be greater,
> higher, and prior to the world itself, since not only the existing
> things which compose the world but also all possibilities have their
> reality through it. But because of the interconnection of all these
> things, this ultimate reason can be found only in a single source. It
> is evident, however, that existing things are continuously issuing
> from this source and are being produced and have been produced by it,
> since no reason appears why one state of the world should issue from
> it rather than another, that of yesterday rather than today's. It is
> clear, too, how God acts not merely physically but freely as well, and
> how there is in him not only the efficient but the final cause of the
> world. Thus we have in him the reason not merely for the greatness and
> power in the world mechanism as already established. but also for the
> goodness and wisdom exerted in establishing it....

    1.  Starting with the numerals $0$ and $1$, one obtains the set of
        natural numbers.

    2.  Each of these numbers is interpreted as representing, or being
        characteristic of, a specific primitive concept.

    3.  By way of logical combination the larger set of general concepts
        is obtained.

    4.  Individual-concepts, i.e. the "ideas" corresponding to
        individuals, will then be defined as maximally consistent
        concepts.

    5.  Among the set of all possible individuals the relation of
        compossibility is introduced.

    6.  Possible worlds are defined as certain maximal collections of
        pairwise compossible individuals.

    7.  The real world is distinguished from its rivals by being the
        richest, i.e. most numerous and, perhaps, also in some other
        respect the best of all possible worlds.

[^2]: Plato(*Timaeus*): "First then, in my judgment, we must make a
    distinction and ask, What is that which always is and has no
    becoming; and what is that which is always becoming and never is?
    That which is apprehended by intelligence and reason is always in
    the same state; but that which is conceived by opinion with the help
    of sensation and without reason, is always in a process of becoming
    and perishing and never really is. Now everything that becomes or is
    created must of necessity be created by some cause, for without a
    cause nothing can be created. The work of the creator, whenever he
    looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his
    work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair
    and perfect; but when he looks to the created only, and uses a
    created pattern, it is not fair or perfect. Was the heaven then or
    the world, whether called by this or by any other more appropriate
    name---assuming the name, I am asking a question which has to be
    asked at the beginning of an enquiry about anything---was the world,
    I say, always in existence and without beginning? or created, and
    had it a beginning? Created, I reply, being visible and tangible and
    having a body, and therefore sensible; and all sensible things are
    apprehended by opinion and sense and are in a process of creation
    and created. Now that which is created must, as we affirm, of
    necessity be created by a cause. But the father and maker of all
    this universe is past finding out; and even if we found him, to tell
    of him to all men would be impossible. And there is still a question
    to be asked about him: Which of the patterns had the artificer in
    view when he made the world---the pattern of the unchangeable, or of
    that which is created? If the world be indeed fair and the artificer
    good, it is manifest that he must have looked to that which is
    eternal; but if what cannot be said without blasphemy is true, then
    to the created pattern. Every one will see that he must have looked
    to, the eternal; for the world is the fairest of creations and he is
    the best of causes. And having been created in this way, the world
    has been framed in the likeness of that which is apprehended by
    reason and mind and is unchangeable, and must therefore of
    necessity, if this is admitted, be a copy of something. Now it is
    all-important that the beginning of everything should be according
    to nature. And in speaking of the copy and the original we may
    assume that words are akin to the matter which they describe; when
    they relate to the lasting and permanent and intelligible, they
    ought to be lasting and unalterable, and, as far as their nature
    allows, irrefutable and immovable---nothing less. But when they
    express only the copy or likeness and not the eternal things
    themselves, they need only be likely and analogous to the real
    words. As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief."

    "He was good, and the good can never have any jealousy of anything.
    And being free from jealousy, he desired that all things should be
    as like himself as they could be. This is in the truest sense the
    origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well in
    believing on the testimony of wise men: God desired that all things
    should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was attainable.
    Wherefore also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest, but
    moving in an irregular and disorderly fashion, out of disorder he
    brought order, considering that this was in every way better than
    the other. Now the deeds of the best could never be or have been
    other than the fairest; and the creator, reflecting on the things
    which are by nature visible, found that no unintelligent creature
    taken as a whole was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole;
    and that intelligence could not be present in anything which was
    devoid of soul. For which reason, when he was framing the universe,
    he put intelligence in soul, and soul in body, that he might be the
    creator of a work which was by nature fairest and best. Wherefore,
    using the language of probability, we may say that the world became
    a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the
    providence of God."

    Plato(*Meno*): "The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been
    born again many times, and having seen all things that exist,
    whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them
    all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to
    remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about
    everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all
    things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say
    learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is
    strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is
    but recollection."

[^3]: Richard Feynman: "Is it true that the particle doesn't just 'take
    the right path' but that it looks at all the other possible
    trajectories? \... The miracle of it all is, of course, that it does
    just that. \... It isn't that a particle takes the path of least
    action but that it smells all the paths in the neighborhood and
    chooses the one that has the least action."

    The Principle of Maximal Variety: Among the set of all possible
    universes compatible with an irreducibly minimal set of structural
    constraints, the actual universe is the one which maximizes the
    variety.

    Ernst Mach: "Science is a form of business. Its purpose is to find
    the maximum amount of the infinite eternal truth with the minimum
    amount of work, in the minimum expenditure of time and with the
    minimum amount of thought effort."

[^7]: Principle of sufficient reason: Every question of the form of why
    is the universe like $X$ rather than $Y$ has a reason sufficient to
    explain why.

    Laplace's principle of insufficient reason (indifference): If there
    is no reason to think differently than that all cases are equally
    possible, then their probabilities are equal. (Equivalent states of
    knowledge should be assigned equivalent epistemic probabilities.)

[^8]: Bertrand Russell: "Leibniz based his philosophy upon two logical
    premises, the law of contradiction and the law of sufficient reason.
    Both depend upon the notion of an 'analytic' proposition, which is
    one in which the predicate is contained in the subject---for
    instance, 'all white men are men.' The law of contradiction states
    that all analytic propositions are true. The law of sufficient
    reason (in the esoteric system only) states that all true
    propositions are analytic."

    "The principle of sufficient reason ...is usually supposed to be, by
    itself, adequate to the deduction of what actually exists. To this
    supposition, it must be confessed, Leibniz's words often lend
    colour. But we shall find that there are really two principles
    included under the same name, the one general, and applying to all
    possible worlds, the other special, and applying only to the actual
    world. Both differ from the law of contradiction, by the fact that
    they apply specially---the former, however, not exclusively---to
    existents, possible or actual. The former, as we shall see, is a
    form of the law of causality, asserting all possible causes to be
    desires or appetites; the latter, on the other hand, is the
    assertion that all actual causation is determined by desire for the
    good. The former we shall find to be metaphysically necessary, while
    the latter is contingent, and applies only to contingents. The
    former is a principle of possible contingents, the latter a
    principle of actual contingents only."

    "Thus the law of sufficient reason, as applied to actual existents,
    reduces itself definitely to the assertion of final causes, in the
    sense that actual desires are always directed towards what appears
    the best. In all actual changes, the consequent can only be deduced
    from the antecedent by using the notion of the good. Where the
    change depends only upon God, it really is for the best; where it
    depends upon a free creature, it is such as seems best to the
    creature, but is often, owing to confused perception, not really the
    best possible change. Such a connection can only be regarded as
    contingent by admitting, as Leibniz does, that a law may be general,
    i.e. may apply to every part of time, without being necessary, i.e.
    without being capable of a statement in which no actual part of time
    is referred to."

    "The sufficient reason for one change rather than another is to be
    found in the nature of activity. In substances which are not free,
    this activity is regulated by general laws, which themselves have a
    sufficient reason in God's perception of fitness; in free
    substances, the sufficient reason lies in the more or less confused
    perception of the good on the part of the substance itself. But in
    no case is the connection between two states in itself necessary; it
    always arises from the perception, either in God or in the creature
    (if this be free), that the change is good."

[^9]: Bertrand Russell: "From what has been said of activity, it is
    plain that those predicates of a given substance which are existents
    in time form one causal series. Leibniz sometimes goes so far in
    this direction as to approach very near to Lotze's doctrine that
    things are laws. All singular things, he says, are subject to
    succession, nor is there anything permanent but the law itself,
    involving continual succession. Successions, he continues, like such
    series as numbers, have the property that, given the first term and
    the law of progression, the remaining terms arise in order. The only
    difference is, that in successions the order is temporal, but in
    numbers the order is that of logical priority. Further, the
    persistence of the same law is the ground for asserting that a new
    temporal existent belongs to the same substance as a past existent.
    The identity of a substance at different times is recognized, he
    says, 'by the persistence of the same law of the series, or of
    continuous simple transition, which leads us to the opinion that one
    and the same subject or monad is changing. That there should be a
    persistent law, involving the future states of that which we
    conceive as the same, is just what I assert to constitute it the
    same substance'. These passages explain very definitely what Leibniz
    means by his phrase, that each monad contains in its nature the law
    of the continuation of the series of its operations. They enable us,
    also, to see what would remain of the doctrine of monads if the
    appeal to substance were dropped. All the predicates of a given
    substance form one causal series: this series might, therefore, be
    taken as defining what we are to mean by one substance, and the
    reference to subject and predicate might be dropped. The plurality
    of substances would then consist in the doctrine, that a given
    existent at a given moment is caused, not by the whole preceding
    state of the universe, but by some one definite existent in the
    preceding moment. This assumption is involved in the ordinary search
    for causes of particulars."

[^18]: Jacob Bernoulli: "It is nevertheless known that there are levels
    in infinity, and that the ratio of one infinity to another infinity
    is still a finite number, and can be expressed either precisely or
    sufficiently precisely for practical use....If five points have been
    observed, all of which are perceived to lie along a parabola, the
    notion of a parabola will be stronger than if only four points had
    been observed: for although there are an infinite number of curves
    which may pass through five points, there is nevertheless beyond
    this infinite number another infinite number---rather, an infinitely
    times more infinite number---of curves which may pass through only
    the first four points and not through the fifth point, all of which
    are excluded by this fifth observation. And yet, I admit that every
    conjecture which is deduced by observations of this sort would be
    quite flimsy and uncertain if it were not conceded that the curve
    sought is one of the class of simple curves; this indeed seems quite
    correct to me, since we see everywhere that nature follows the
    simplest paths."
