How do I use Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some basic syntax rules to get you started:

## Headers

Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

```
# This is a heading 1
## This is a heading 2
### This is a heading 3
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

- *Italic* text can be created using single asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold** text can be created using double asterisks or underscores.
